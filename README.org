#+title:symb0l

How often do you really type numbers using the number row?

symb0l is for you if:
- you do data entry using the numpad, and/or
- you type symbols more often than you type numbers

symb0l remaps the top row of numbers to more common symbols used in programming or LaTeX input, so you donâ€™t waste precious keyboard real estate on keys you rarely use. Numbers are still available via the Shift key, or via the the Fn keys.
